## Introduction

This project is designed to demonstrate fundamental audio processing techniques using MATLAB. By following the steps provided, users can capture and analyze audio signals, apply various transformations, and generate DTMF tones similar to those used in telecommunication systems.

## Features

- **Audio Recording**: Capture audio signals with specified parameters.
- **Time Domain Analysis**: Visualize the amplitude variation of recorded audio over time.
- **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Analyze the frequency components of the audio signal using Fourier Transform.
- **Audio Reversal**: Reverse the recorded audio signal and play it back.
- **Noise Reduction**: Apply a moving average filter to reduce noise in the audio signal.
- **DTMF Tone Generation**: Generate and plot DTMF tones used in telephone keypads.

## Installation

To run this project, you need MATLAB installed on your computer. You can download MATLAB from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
